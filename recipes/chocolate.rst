Chocolate
==========
**Makes**: 150g /
**Equipment**: small sauce pan, chocolate mold (optional)

Homemade chocolate is much better than store-bought chocolate, 
because you can adjust the former to your own taste, e.g. make 
it fattier and less sweet than the latter.
Plus it takes only about 25 minutes to make, if you buy the cocoa butter
and cocoa powder premade instead of making your own from cocoa nibs.
The downside to the recipe below is that the chocolate needs to stay
refrigerated to keep its smooth texture.
Perhaps adding some lecithin would address that issue.
I need to experiment more.

Ingredients
-----------
- 100   g   cocoa butter
- 50    g   cocoa powder
- 1     t   vanilla extract
- 2 |--| 3  t   maple syrup


Directions
----------
#. Melt the cocoa butter in a sauce pan over low heat.
#. Remove from heat and whisk in the remaining ingredients.
#. Pour into a chocolate mold, pan, baking paper, something like that.
#. Chill in the freezer until solid (about 15 minutes).

Variations
----------
- Replace the vanilla extract with 1/2 t of peppermint extract
- Add 1/2 t orange zest, 1/2 t cinnamon, and 1/2 t ground chilis
- Replace the cocoa butter with coconut oil
