Donate
=======
If you like VegeHead and want to help keep it on the Internet, *you can now* by making a small donation toward web hosting:

.. raw:: html

    <form action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_top">
      <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="BMR5EKT25XFNN" />
      <input title="VegeHead's tip jar" alt="Drop a tip into VegeHead's jar via PayPal" name="submit"
      src="_static/donate.svg"
      type="image" width="100" />
    </form>

That's a PayPal button for credit/debit card payments.
Alternatively, you can donate fiat currency into my Kiwibank account at Alex Raichev 38-9009-0530201-00, Bitcoin into my wallet at 1ACZVf3fBbyBJbv97HnteNV8mDzdWT2Wd8, or Ethereum into my wallet at 0xF2c854886ea636B8F8E30B87b9afDCFA28B5B243.
Thanks for your support!
