African Peanut Stew
====================
| **Serves**: 5
| **Equipment**: pressure cooker or large pot


Ingredients
--------------
- 1 T olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 T fresh ginger, grated
- 400 mL chopped tomatoes
- 1 L vegetable broth
- 400 g kumara, cubed to side length ~25 mm
- ½ c crunchy peanut butter
- 4 c chopped collard greens, or any brassica leaves
- 1 t ground cumin
- 1 t chili flakes
- salt to taste
- some chopped coriander leaves for garnish


Directions
------------
1. In the pressure cooker, heat the oil, then sauté the onion and garlic until the onion becomes soft and translucent, about 3 minutes.
2. Add the remaining ingredients, except for the salt and garnish, and cook at high pressure for 7 minutes, or until the kumara is tender.
3. Salt, garnish, and serve.


Notes
-------
You can also cook this dish without a pressure cooker in a large pot.
To do that, replace step 2 above with this instruction: add the remaining ingredients, except for the salt and garnish, bring to boil, then simmer covered for about 15 minutes or until the kumara is tender.
