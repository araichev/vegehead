Almost Minestrone
=================
| **Serves**: 6
| **Equipment**: pressure cooker

I say almost, because there's no pasta or rice.

Ingredients
------------
- 3   T   olive oil
- 1       onion, diced
- 2       cloves garlic, diced
- 1       100 mm strip kombu, diced; scissors help here
- 1       bay leaf
- 1   t   oregano leaf dried
- 1   t   basil leaf dried
- 1   t   marjoram leaf dried
- 1   t   fennel seed
- 1   t   chili flakes
- 400 g   diced tomatoes
- 1600 mL water
- 2   c   assorted dried beans (but not chickpeas, because they take too long to cook compared to other beans), soaked for at least 4 hours
- 1       large carrot, diced
- 2   c   greens, such as kale
- 1   t   salt or to taste


Directions
----------
#. In a pressure cooker, heat 1 T olive oil and saut√© the onion and garlic until golden.
#. Add in everything else except the salt, and pressure cook at high pressure for however long the slowest cooking bean needs, e.g. 14 minutes for a kidney bean + lentils combination.
#. Add the remaining olive oil and salt and serve.
