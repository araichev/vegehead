==================
**Makes**: 185g /
**Equipment**: sauce pan, grater, thermometer, chocolate mold (optional)


Ingredients
-----------
- 100   g   cocoa butter 
- 80    g   cocoa powder
- 1     t   crushed vanilla beans
- 2     t   sugar


Directions
----------
#. Finely grate 1% of the cocoa butter (1 g) or a little more and set aside
#. Melt the remaining 99% of the cocoa butter in a sauce pan or double boiler until it reaches 46 |o| C 
#. Remove from heat and thoroughly mix in the remaining ingredients
#. Cool/heat the mix until it reaches 35 |o| C
#. Mix in the grated cocoa butter to seed the crystallization of the chocolate
#. Pour into a chocolate mold, pan, baking paper, something like that
#. Let it cool at room temperature until it hardens

Variations
----------
- Replace the vanilla with 2 t of diced peppermint leaves
- Add ½ t orange zest, ½ t cinnamon, and ½ t ground chili

Notes
------
The heating and cooling to specific temperatures in this recipe tempers the chocolate so that it hardens and remains hard at room temperature. 
Also, including liquids in this recipe would ruin or make very difficult the tempering.

If you don't want to temper the chocolate, you can skip steps 4, 5, and 7 and cool the chocolate in the refrigerator, but you better keep it there.
Bringing the chocolate back to room temperature will probably cause melting and mealiness.
