Variations
----------
- Replace the vanilla with 2 t of diced peppermint leaves

Notes
------
The heating and cooling to specific temperatures in this recipe tempers the chocolate so that it hardens and remains hard at room temperature.
Also, including liquids in this recipe would ruin or make very difficult the tempering.
If the chocolate does not temper, then something went wrong.
Try the melting process again with the failed batch.
