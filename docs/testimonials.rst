"OMG! The Chickpea curry is amazing! We cooked it last night. I would say the best curry we have ever made. Very impressed!  Honestly it was soooo good! I'm making it a weekly."
~ A workmate of a friend

"There's something special about VegeHead. It's a lot like Alex: healthful and straightforward yet with lots of depth. I like how it's well thought out, easy to read and easy to cook!  I'll return to it again and again!  My favourites:  cabbage salad, red cabbage salad, and fried kumara. Yummo!!"
