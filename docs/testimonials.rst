"OMG! The Chickpea curry is amazing! We cooked it last night. I would say the best curry we have ever made. Very impressed!  Honestly it was soooo good! I'm making it a weekly."

"There's something special about VegeHead. It's a lot like Alex: healthful and straightforward, yet with lots of depth. I like how it's well thought out, easy to read and easy to cook!  I'll return to it again and again!  My favourites:  cabbage salad, red cabbage salad, and fried kumara. Yummo!"
~Jenny Klosser

"Once upon a time I owned dozens of GF DF RSF V cookbooks and would regularly open 50 [web browser] tabs at a time searching for the perfect recipe. I thought I was shit hot at cooking until life graced me with VegeHead. VegeHead has eliminated my mental frazzle associated with cooking and significantly reduced the amount of time spent slaving in the kitchen. Plus, my taste buds and gut are all the better for it! This cookbook is the only tab you need open, ever."

"Darwin's *On the Origins of Species*, Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason*; there are some influential bodies of work in recent history. In my life, none more so than VegeHead. I've yet to encounter a recipe I haven't enjoyed or been able to easily make, and I like the layout's refined simplicity â€”no scrolling through the life story of each 'Chosen' ingredient. 5/5" ~Matt McDonald

"Tip #1: Make sure you have a frying pan. Failing that, stop by Alex's, because there is a whole lot more know-how in that frylet than I have words for. C'est YUM." ~Evania Natalie-Anne Premadaya Quin Vallyon

"Alex makes good shit. The good shit that Alex makes is here. This is legit food. If I weren't such a maverick and actually followed recipes, this would be the place for me. If you don't like legit food, might I recommend a trip to the freezer aisle of your local big box grocery store where you might find something appropriately prosaic?" ~Lewis Thorwaldson
