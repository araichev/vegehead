"OMG! The Chickpea curry is amazing! We cooked it last night. I would say the best curry we have ever made. Very impressed!  Honestly it was soooo good! I'm making it a weekly."
~ A friend of a friend

"There's something special about VegeHead. It's a lot like Alex: healthful and straightforward, yet with lots of depth. I like how it's well thought out, easy to read and easy to cook!  I'll return to it again and again!  My favourites:  cabbage salad, red cabbage salad, and fried kumara. Yummo!"
~ Jenny Klosser

"Once upon a time I owned dozens of GF DF RSF V cookbooks and would regularly open 50 [web browser] tabs at a time searching for the perfect recipe. I thought I was shit hot at cooking until life graced me with VegeHead. VegeHead has eliminated my mental frazzle associated with cooking and significantly reduced the amount of time spent slaving in the kitchen. Plus, my taste buds and gut are all the better for it! This cookbook is the only tab you need open, ever."
~ Megan Coup

"Would I go as far as saying VegeHead saved my relationship? Some dinners. I've yet to encounter a recipe I haven't enjoyed or been able to easily make, and I like the refined simplicity of the layout with no life story for each chosen ingredient. Happy stomachs, happy house."
