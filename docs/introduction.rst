Introduction
=============
This is an open-source cookbook and a work in progress.
In compiling it, i set the following requirements.

**Yummy**.
The food should taste great.

**Fast.**
The food should take at most 30 minutes to make, excluding trivial preparation, such as soaking legumes overnight to remove their phytic acid.
I enjoy cooking but don’t want to spend a lot of time doing it.
To fulfill this requirement, many of the recipes use a pressure cooker.
If you don't have one, then just use a pot and cook for roughly twice as long.
Oh, i also cheated: some of the recipes, such as the almond rolls, take slightly longer than 30 minutes to make, but those that do are too good to omit.

**Vegetarian**.
The food should not require the killing of animals.
I like to minimize the animal suffering involved in my meals and going vegetarian is a step in the right direction.
Going vegan is a bigger step that i'm not willing to take at present.

**Pre-industrial**.
The ingredients should be as close as possible to the ones eaten by our pre-industrial ancestors.
That rules out 20th-century edible food-like substances (synthetic flavorings, high-fructose corn syrup, skim milk powder, etc.), food grown with synthetic pesticides, and even canned food because of the shady chemical linings used in the cans.
I don’t trust that stuff, but i get lazy and use canned tomatoes.

**Grain-free**.
The food should not contain grains: wheat, rice, corn, oats, etc.
I’m eating less carbohydrate these days, and cutting out grains is one simple way to do that.
I’m cutting back on sugars too, which is the greater devil, but i still include some sweet recipes here, such as ice cream.
Mmm, ice cream.

In this book, i use the following abbreviations:

c = cup, T = tablespoon, t = teaspoon.

I also use metric units such as liters, kilograms, and Celsius with their standard abbreviations.
