Praise Baking Soda
======================
Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, and NaHCO3, is a versatile chemical compound.  Besides baking with it, you can use it as part of

- Tooth powder: mix three parts baking soda and one part salt and brush your - teeth with the stuff
- Mouthwash: add baking soda to water and rinse to neutralize mouth acids and - kill bacteria
- Body deodorant: dampen your armpits with water and apply a little baking soda
- Exfoliant: dampen your skin with water and gently rub with baking soda
- Cleaner: sprinkle some baking soda on a dirty surface, add your favorite - liquid cleaner (water, vinegar, etc.), and rub.  Donâ€™t do this on aluminum surfaces, though, as baking soda attacks the thin nonreactive protective oxide layer of this otherwise very reactive metal.
