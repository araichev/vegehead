Vegehead
**********
This is an open-source cookbook with the following requirements on its recipes.

**Yummy**.
**Yummy**.
The food should taste great.

**Fast.** 
The food should take at most 30 minutes to make, excluding trivial preparation, such as soaking legumes overnight to remove their phytic acid.
I enjoy cooking but don’t want to spend a lot of time doing it. 
To fulfill this requirement, several of the recipes below use a pressure cooker.

**Vegetarian**.
The food should not require the killing of animals. 
I like to minimize the animal suffering involved in my meals and going vegetarian is a step in the right direction. 
Going vegan is a bigger step that i'm not willing to take at present.

**Pre-industrial**.
The ingredients should be as close as possible to the ones eaten by our pre-industrial ancestors. 
That rules out 20th-century edible food-like substances (synthetic flavorings, high-fructose corn syrup, skim milk powder, etc.), food grown with synthetic pesticides, and even canned food because of the shadey chemical linings used in the cans.
I don’t trust that stuff. 

**Grain-free**. 
The food should not contain grains: wheat, rice, corn, oats, etc. 
I’m eating less carbohydrate these days, and cutting out grains is one simple way to do that. 
I’m cutting back on sugars, too, which is probably more important health-wise, but i'll still include some sweet recipes, such as ice cream. 
Mmm.
