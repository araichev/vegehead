This is an open-source cookbook.  Feel free to contribute.


Requirements
============
In compiling this cookbook, i set the following requirements.

**Yummy.** 
The food should taste great.

**Fast.** 
The food should take at most 30 minutes to make. 
I enjoy cooking but don’t want to spend a lot of time doing it. 
To fulfill this requirement, several of the recipes below use a pressure cooker.

**Vegetarian.** 
The food should not require the killing of animals. 
I like to minimize the animal suffering involved in my meals and going vegetarian is a step in the right direction. 
Going vegan is a bigger step.

**Pre-industrial.** 
The ingredients should be as close as possible to the ones eaten by our pre-industrial ancestors. 
That rules out 20th-century edible food-like substances (synthetic flavorings, high-fructose corn syrup, skim milk powder, etc.) and food grown with synthetic pesticides. 
I don’t trust that stuff. 
I’ll let canned foods slide, though. 

**Grain-free.** 
The food should not contain grains: wheat, rice, corn, oats, etc. 
Because i’ve read that it’s healthy, i’m eating less carbohydrate these days, and cutting out grains is one simple way to do that. I’m cutting back on sugars too but still include some sweet recipes, such as ice cream. Mmm.
